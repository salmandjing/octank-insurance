# Octank Insurance - Eligibility & Coverage FAQ

## General Eligibility

### Who is eligible for Octank auto insurance?
Octank Insurance provides auto coverage to licensed drivers aged 16 and older in all 50 states. Eligibility is based on driving history, vehicle type, location, and other risk factors.

### What affects my premium?
Your premium is calculated based on:
- **Driving record**: Accidents, tickets, and violations in the past 5 years
- **Age and experience**: Younger and newer drivers typically pay more
- **Vehicle**: Year, make, model, safety ratings, and theft risk
- **Location**: Urban areas generally have higher premiums
- **Coverage level**: Higher limits and lower deductibles cost more
- **Credit score**: Used in most states as a rating factor
- **Annual mileage**: Lower mileage may qualify for discounts

### Can I add drivers to my policy?
Yes, you can add additional drivers to your policy. All household members of driving age must be listed on your policy as either:
- **Rated drivers**: Covered to drive your vehicles (affects premium)
- **Excluded drivers**: Explicitly excluded from coverage (no premium impact)

## Coverage Questions

### What's the difference between my deductible and out-of-pocket maximum?
- **Deductible**: The amount you pay before insurance kicks in for each claim. For example, if you have a $500 deductible and $3,000 in damage, you pay $500 and Octank pays $2,500.
- **Out-of-pocket maximum**: The most you'll pay in a policy year across all claims. Once reached, Octank covers 100% of additional covered costs.

### Am I covered if I drive someone else's car?
Generally, your Octank policy follows you as a driver. However, the car owner's insurance is primary coverage. Your policy acts as secondary coverage if the owner's insurance is insufficient.

### Does my policy cover rental cars?
- If you have **Rental Car Reimbursement** coverage: Yes, up to $50/day for 30 days when your car is being repaired after a covered claim
- For rental cars you drive while traveling: Your comprehensive and collision coverage extends to rental vehicles in the US and Canada. International coverage requires a separate rider.

### Am I covered for rideshare driving (Uber/Lyft)?
Standard Octank auto policies do **not** cover you while driving for a rideshare company. You need our **Rideshare Endorsement** which provides:
- Coverage during Period 1 (app on, waiting for a ride request)
- Supplemental coverage during Periods 2 and 3
- Contact your agent to add this endorsement

### What happens if my car is totaled?
If repair costs exceed your vehicle's actual cash value (ACV):
1. Octank will declare the vehicle a total loss
2. You'll receive the ACV minus your deductible
3. If you owe more than the ACV on your loan, **Gap Coverage** pays the difference
4. You have 30 days to accept or dispute the valuation

## Billing & Payments

### What payment options are available?
- **Monthly**: Pay in 12 installments (small service fee applies)
- **Semi-annual**: Pay every 6 months (5% discount)
- **Annual**: Pay once per year (10% discount)
- **Autopay**: Set up automatic payments from bank account or credit card

### What happens if I miss a payment?
1. **Grace period**: You have 10 days after the due date to make payment
2. **Late fee**: $25 late fee applied after grace period
3. **Notice of cancellation**: If payment is not received within 30 days, a cancellation notice is sent
4. **Policy cancellation**: Policy is cancelled 10 days after cancellation notice
5. **Reinstatement**: You may reinstate within 30 days of cancellation without a lapse in coverage
