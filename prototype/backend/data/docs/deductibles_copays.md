# Octank Insurance - Understanding Deductibles & Cost Sharing

## What is a Deductible?

A deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in. For example, if you have a $500 deductible and file a claim for $3,000 in damage:
- **You pay**: $500 (your deductible)
- **Octank pays**: $2,500 (the remaining amount)

### How Deductibles Work
- Deductibles apply **per claim**, not per year
- You choose your deductible amount when you purchase your policy
- Higher deductibles = lower monthly premiums
- Lower deductibles = higher monthly premiums
- Deductibles apply to collision and comprehensive claims
- Deductibles do NOT apply to liability claims (those pay the other party)

## Deductible Options at Octank

### Collision Deductible
Applies when your vehicle is damaged in a collision:

| Deductible Amount | Typical Monthly Savings vs. $250 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| $250 | Base rate |
| $500 | Save $15-25/month |
| $1,000 | Save $30-50/month |

### Comprehensive Deductible
Applies for non-collision damage (theft, weather, vandalism):

| Deductible Amount | Typical Monthly Savings vs. $250 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| $250 | Base rate |
| $500 | Save $10-15/month |
| $1,000 | Save $20-30/month |

**Note**: You can choose different deductible amounts for collision and comprehensive coverage.

## Choosing the Right Deductible

### Consider a Lower Deductible ($250-$500) if:
- You have limited savings and couldn't easily cover a large out-of-pocket expense
- You have a newer or more expensive vehicle
- You live in an area with high accident or theft rates
- You prefer the peace of mind of lower out-of-pocket costs

### Consider a Higher Deductible ($1,000) if:
- You have an emergency fund that could cover the deductible
- You have a strong driving record and rarely file claims
- You want to minimize your monthly premium
- Your vehicle has a lower value

## Out-of-Pocket Maximum

Your out-of-pocket maximum is the most you'll pay in a policy year across all claims. Once you reach this amount, Octank covers 100% of additional covered costs for the remainder of the policy year.

### Out-of-Pocket Maximum by Plan

| Plan Tier | Out-of-Pocket Maximum |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Basic | $8,000 |
| Standard | $5,000 |
| Premium | $3,000 |

### How It Works
Example: You have a Standard plan with a $500 deductible and $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum.
1. **Claim 1** (March): $2,000 damage → You pay $500 deductible → Total paid: $500
2. **Claim 2** (July): $4,000 damage → You pay $500 deductible → Total paid: $1,000
3. **Claim 3** (October): $8,000 damage → You pay $500 deductible → Total paid: $1,500

In this scenario, you'd never exceed your $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum even with multiple claims.

## When Deductibles Are Waived

In certain situations, you may NOT have to pay your deductible:
- **Not-at-fault accident**: If the other driver is 100% at fault and their insurance pays, your deductible is waived
- **Uninsured motorist claim**: Deductible may be waived depending on state law
- **Windshield-only claim**: Many states require $0 deductible for windshield replacement
- **Deductible recovery**: If Octank recovers costs from the at-fault party (subrogation), your deductible is refunded

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I change my deductible mid-policy?
Yes, you can change your deductible at any time. The change takes effect immediately, and your premium will be adjusted on a prorated basis.

### Does my deductible apply to rental car coverage?
No. Rental car reimbursement coverage pays up to $50/day with no deductible. However, if the rental car is damaged, your regular collision deductible applies.

### What if I can't afford my deductible after an accident?
Contact your adjuster to discuss payment options. Some repair shops offer payment plans, and in some cases, Octank can advance funds against the expected claim settlement.

### Is my deductible the same for all types of claims?
Not necessarily. You may have different deductibles for collision and comprehensive coverage. Check your policy declarations page for your specific deductible amounts.
